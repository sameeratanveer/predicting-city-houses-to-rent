House Rent Prediction Using Kaggle Dataset
This project involves predicting house rental prices using the Houses to Rent dataset from Kaggle, which originally consisted of 6080 instances and 14 features. After cleaning the data and removing duplicates, it was reduced to 5882 instances and 13 features.

One key takeaway from this project is understanding how highly imbalanced data can significantly affect model prediction power. This dataset provided a valuable opportunity to dive deep into column transformations, which are crucial for accurate predictions.

Through this dataset, I have gained hands-on experience in:

Removing parts of strings from column data.
Encoding categorical variables to numerical values.
Applying the replace() function and utilizing regex for more complex column transformations.
This dataset is an excellent resource for anyone looking to practice and master column transformation techniques.
